# Day 20 - Machine Learning Workflow

Pipelines, chaining

## Model selection

1. Regression models are _parametric_
   1. Fast to train (SGD)
   2. Requires prior asusmptions
2. KNN and Kernel-SVM are _non-parametric_.
   1. Can find complex features
   2. Prone to overfitting

## Pipelines

Chain of operations (preprocessing, training, predicting). Perform multiple steps in sequence.
Always fit using `train set`, always predict using `test set`.

Goals:

1. `Impute` missing values
2. `Scale` numerical features
3. `Encode`categorical features
4. `Fine-tune` model and preprocessing

`One Hot Encoder` can only be used for boolean or objects.

### Models in pipelines

They can include:

- transformers
- models

Only in the end of the pipe we use `y_train`.

## AutoML

### Tree-based Pipeline Optimization Tool (TPOT)
